Project Overview: Digital Clock
This project displays a live digital clock on a webpage. It shows the current time in a format of hours:minutes:seconds along with an AM/PM indicator. The clock is styled with basic CSS to center it on the page and give it a clean, simple design. The time updates every second, thanks to JavaScript, which fetches the current system time and refreshes the display.
